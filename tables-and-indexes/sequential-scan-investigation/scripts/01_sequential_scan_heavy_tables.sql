SCRIPT NAME:
01_sequential_scan_heavy_tables.sql

PURPOSE:
Confirms which tables are experiencing the most sequential-scan read volume.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'tables-and-indexes/sequential-scan-investigation'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_statistics_freshness.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Focus only on tables large enough (check table_size) that a seq scan is genuinely costly -- small tables in this list are not a concern.
===============================================================================

-- Tables where sequential scans dominate over index scans, weighted by
-- table size, to prioritize the biggest opportunity first. A high seq_scan
-- count alone is not necessarily bad (small lookup tables are often scanned
-- sequentially by design and that is faster than an index scan) -- the
-- seq_tup_read/seq_scan ratio and table size are what indicate a genuinely
-- expensive full-table scan pattern.
