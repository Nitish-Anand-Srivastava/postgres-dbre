SCRIPT NAME:
02_sequential_scan_heavy_tables.sql

PURPOSE:
Finds large tables with a high sequential-scan-to-row-read ratio, a proxy for a missing index on a filter/join column.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'tables-and-indexes/missing-index-candidates'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
../../schema-changes/concurrent-index-build/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Cross-reference against pg_stat_statements query text for these tables to identify the specific column(s) driving the scans before adding an index.

-- Tables where sequential scans dominate over index scans, weighted by
-- table size, to prioritize the biggest opportunity first. A high seq_scan
-- count alone is not necessarily bad (small lookup tables are often scanned
-- sequentially by design and that is faster than an index scan) -- the
-- seq_tup_read/seq_scan ratio and table size are what indicate a genuinely
-- expensive full-table scan pattern.
