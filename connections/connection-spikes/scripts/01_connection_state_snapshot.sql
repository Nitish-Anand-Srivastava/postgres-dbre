SCRIPT NAME:
01_connection_state_snapshot.sql

PURPOSE:
Snapshots current connection counts by state as the starting point for spike investigation.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'connections/connection-spikes'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_connections_by_application.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Re-run this every few seconds during an active spike to track its trajectory; compare against the pre-spike baseline.
