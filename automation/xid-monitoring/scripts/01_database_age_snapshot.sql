SCRIPT NAME:
01_database_age_snapshot.sql

PURPOSE:
Database-level XID age snapshot, intended to be captured on every scheduled run.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'automation/xid-monitoring'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_table_age_snapshot.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Record pct_of_freeze_max_age from every scheduled run so a trend is visible over time, not just a single current value. Alert when it crosses your organization's chosen proactive threshold (commonly 40-50%).

-- Transaction ID (XID) age per database, measured against datfrozenxid.
-- autovacuum_freeze_max_age (default 200,000,000) is the point at which
-- autovacuum is forced to run in every table regardless of cost limits;
-- autovacuum_vacuum_freeze_min_age / vacuum_failsafe_age (default
-- 1,600,000,000) is the emergency threshold before wraparound-protection
-- kicks in and PostgreSQL refuses new writes to protect data integrity.
