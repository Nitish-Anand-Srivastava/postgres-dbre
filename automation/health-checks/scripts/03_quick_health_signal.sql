SCRIPT NAME:
03_quick_health_signal.sql

PURPOSE:
The single lightweight, read-only health signal a scheduled job should capture on every run: instance role, connection headroom, and transaction ID age.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'automation/health-checks'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_scheduling_runbook.md, ../../database-health/comprehensive-health-check/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
This is the deliberately small subset of database-health/comprehensive-health-check that is cheap enough to run every few minutes unattended: it answers 'am I talking to the writer', 'are we close to the connection ceiling', and 'is XID age climbing'. Alert on pct_utilized above roughly 80% sustained across consecutive runs and on pct_of_freeze_max_age above 40-50%; treat is_reader_instance = true on what the scheduler believes is the writer endpoint as an immediate signal that a failover has occurred (see replication-and-ha/failover-investigation). Anything this script flags is a trigger to run the full comprehensive-health-check workflow, not a diagnosis on its own.

-- Is this instance currently a writer or a reader? On Aurora, every reader

-- it is replaying redo log records shipped from the shared Aurora storage
-- layer, not a WAL stream from the writer. Always confirm this before
-- interpreting any other replication-related query on this connection.
