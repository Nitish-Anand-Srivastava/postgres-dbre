SCRIPT NAME:
02_invalid_indexes_snapshot.sql

PURPOSE:
INVALID-index snapshot, intended to be captured on every scheduled run so a failed concurrent build is caught promptly rather than discovered incidentally.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'automation/index-monitoring'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_index_usage_and_size_snapshot.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Any row here found on a scheduled run that was empty on the previous run means a concurrent index or REINDEX build failed since then -- correlate the timing against recent deployment/migration activity and route to tables-and-indexes/invalid-indexes for the safe drop-and-rebuild remediation.

-- Indexes left in an INVALID state, almost always because a previous
-- CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY or REINDEX CONCURRENTLY failed partway through
-- (a killed session, statement_timeout, or deadlock). Invalid indexes are
-- not used by the planner but still consume storage and slow down writes,
-- so they should be dropped and, if needed, recreated concurrently.
