SCRIPT NAME:
01_connection_and_session_metrics.sql

PURPOSE:
Snapshots current session state grouped by database/state/wait event, and connection utilization against max_connections.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'observability/postgres-metrics'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_database_throughput_and_cache_metrics.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
This is the highest-frequency signal worth collecting -- a pooled application's connection count and state distribution should look nearly identical from one collection interval to the next. A sudden shift in the state mix (a jump in idle-in-transaction, or in a specific wait_event_type) is actionable within seconds, unlike the slower-moving counters in the rest of this workflow.

-- On Aurora, max_connections is derived from the instance class's memory
-- (via the parameter group formula) rather than freely set, so headroom
-- must be planned around instance class, not just the GUC value alone.
