===============================================================================
SCRIPT NAME:
01_current_activity.sql

PURPOSE:
Snapshot of current session/state activity to confirm whether the reported slow query is still running.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'performance/slow-queries'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_long_running_queries.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
If the reported query's session no longer appears here, gather forensic evidence from pg_stat_statements (script 03) instead of chasing a live session.
