SCRIPT NAME:
04_wait_events.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks the specific wait event(s) for the backend(s) running the slow query.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 04 of workflow 'performance/slow-queries'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
05_lock_contention.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A non-null wait_event on the specific backend means the query itself is not the bottleneck -- pivot to the resource indicated (Lock, IO, IPC).

-- Aggregated wait events across all current backends. PostgreSQL 17 exposes
-- a canonical description of every wait event in pg_wait_events -- join to
-- it so unfamiliar wait_event values are self-explanatory without needing
-- the manual open.
