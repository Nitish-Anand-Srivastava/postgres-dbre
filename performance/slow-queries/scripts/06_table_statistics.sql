===============================================================================
SCRIPT NAME:
06_table_statistics.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks table-level statistics (row counts, dead tuples, last analyze) for the query's target table(s).

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 06 of workflow 'performance/slow-queries'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
07_index_usage.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A high pct_modified_since_analyze combined with a stale last_analyze/last_autoanalyze strongly suggests the planner is working from outdated row estimates.

-- Tables whose planner statistics may be stale relative to how much the
-- table has changed since the last ANALYZE. n_mod_since_analyze counts
-- inserts+updates+deletes since the last analyze; a large value relative to
-- table size means the planner's row estimates (and therefore its join
-- order / index choice) can be significantly wrong.
