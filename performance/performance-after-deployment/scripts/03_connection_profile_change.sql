===============================================================================
SCRIPT NAME:
03_connection_profile_change.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks current connection composition by application_name, to detect a pool-size or service-count change shipped with the deployment.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'performance/performance-after-deployment'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_lingering_migration_sessions.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Compare total connections per application_name against the pre-deployment baseline; an increase proportional to a new service replica count is expected, but an unexpected spike suggests a pool misconfiguration.
