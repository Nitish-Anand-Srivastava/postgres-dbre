SCRIPT NAME:
03_io_by_backend_type.sql

PURPOSE:
Breaks down I/O by backend type (client backend, autovacuum, checkpointer, etc.) using pg_stat_io.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
pg_stat_io view (PostgreSQL 16+) available; track_io_timing recommended for populated timing columns.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'performance/high-iops'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_checkpoint_frequency.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
If autovacuum or checkpointer backend types dominate reads/writes, the fix is scheduling/tuning (vacuum cost limits, checkpoint_timeout), not application query optimization.

-- Per-backend-type I/O statistics (added PostgreSQL 16, still current in
-- 17). Useful to see whether I/O pressure is coming from regular client
-- backends, autovacuum workers, or background writer/checkpointer activity.
--
-- IMPORTANT (verified against Aurora PostgreSQL 17.7): pg_stat_io on
-- PostgreSQL 17 does NOT have read_bytes/write_bytes/extend_bytes columns
-- -- those were only added in PostgreSQL 18. On 17, every I/O operation is
-- the same fixed size, reported separately as `op_bytes` (typically 8192,
-- one buffer page), so the actual byte volume must be derived numerically
-- as reads * op_bytes / writes * op_bytes rather than read directly.
-- Referencing read_bytes/write_bytes directly on 17 raises
-- "column does not exist".
