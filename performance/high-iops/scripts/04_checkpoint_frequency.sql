===============================================================================
SCRIPT NAME:
04_checkpoint_frequency.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks checkpoint frequency and the ratio of forced vs. scheduled checkpoints, a major source of write I/O.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 04 of workflow 'performance/high-iops'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
05_temp_file_io.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A high pct_forced_checkpoints means max_wal_size is too small for the current write rate, forcing frequent, bursty checkpoint writes instead of smooth, timed ones.

-- Checkpointer statistics. PostgreSQL 17 moved these counters out of
-- pg_stat_bgwriter into their own pg_stat_checkpointer view -- do not query
-- pg_stat_bgwriter for checkpoint counters on 17, they no longer exist
-- there. Frequent num_requested (forced) checkpoints relative to num_timed
-- (scheduled) checkpoints indicates checkpoint_timeout/max_wal_size are too
-- small for the current write rate.
