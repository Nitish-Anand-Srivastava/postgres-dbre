SCRIPT NAME:
03_lock_wait_check.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks for blocked sessions as a latency amplifier that would not show up in a query's own plan.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'performance/high-latency'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_connection_headroom.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Any sustained blocked_duration here means part of the reported latency is lock-wait time, not execution time -- pivot to concurrency-and-locking.

-- Every session currently blocked waiting on at least one lock, and the
-- pid(s) directly blocking it via the built-in pg_blocking_pids() helper
-- (this correctly follows lock-wait-queue order, unlike a naive self-join
-- on pg_locks).
