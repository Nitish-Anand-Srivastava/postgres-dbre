SCRIPT NAME:
02_lock_serialization_check.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks for lock waits that would force otherwise-concurrent transactions to serialize.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'performance/throughput-degradation'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_autovacuum_and_checkpoint_competition.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A queue of sessions waiting on the same relation/row lock, especially with a long-held granted lock at the head of the queue, is the classic serialization signature behind throughput degradation.

-- that is also blocking someone else. This is the ground truth for "who
