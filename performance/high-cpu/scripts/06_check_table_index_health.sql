SCRIPT NAME:
06_check_table_index_health.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks for sequential-scan-heavy tables and stale statistics that commonly cause CPU-expensive plans.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 06 of workflow 'performance/high-cpu'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
../../tables-and-indexes/missing-index-candidates/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Large tables with a high seq_tup_read/seq_scan ratio and low idx_scan are strong candidates for a missing index; cross-reference with the specific queries found in scripts 02/03 before adding an index.

-- Tables where sequential scans dominate over index scans, weighted by
-- table size, to prioritize the biggest opportunity first. A high seq_scan
-- count alone is not necessarily bad (small lookup tables are often scanned
-- sequentially by design and that is faster than an index scan) -- the
-- seq_tup_read/seq_scan ratio and table size are what indicate a genuinely
-- expensive full-table scan pattern.
