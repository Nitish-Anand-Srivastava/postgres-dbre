SCRIPT NAME:
01_load_composition_by_wait_event.sql

PURPOSE:
Breaks current session load down by wait_event_type/wait_event to identify the dominant contributor.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'performance/high-database-load'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_load_by_application_and_database.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Rank the wait_event_type groups by backend_count. Whichever dominates tells you which specialized workflow to pivot into next.

-- it so unfamiliar wait_event values are self-explanatory without needing
