SCRIPT NAME:
05_connection_headroom.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks connection count against max_connections headroom, since a growing backlog itself compounds load.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 05 of workflow 'performance/high-database-load'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
../../connections/connection-exhaustion/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Utilization approaching 80-90% of max_connections combined with high load suggests connection pooling or pool-size tuning is needed in addition to any query-level fix.

-- Current connection utilization vs. the effective connection ceiling.
-- On Aurora, max_connections is derived from the instance class's memory
-- (via the parameter group formula) rather than freely set, so headroom
-- must be planned around instance class, not just the GUC value alone.
