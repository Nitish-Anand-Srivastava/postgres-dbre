SCRIPT NAME:
01_pgss_regression_candidates.sql

PURPOSE:
Ranks statements by mean execution time and call volume to identify candidate regressions and quantify their current cost.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor`, plus SELECT on `pg_stat_statements` (granted automatically to `pg_read_all_stats` once the extension is created; otherwise `GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_statements TO <role>;`).

PREREQUISITES:
pg_stat_statements extension must be created in the current database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'performance/query-regression'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_invalid_or_missing_indexes.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Cross-reference the queryid against APM/dashboards for a 'known good' historical mean_exec_time; a large relative increase is the regression signal.
