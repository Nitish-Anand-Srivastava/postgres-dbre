SCRIPT NAME:
04_table_size_growth.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks current table and index sizes to assess whether data growth alone could explain a plan flip (e.g. nested loop no longer viable).

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 04 of workflow 'performance/query-regression'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
05_sequential_scans.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Compare current sizes against the last time the query was known to perform well; crossing common planner thresholds (e.g. table no longer fits comfortably in effective_cache_size) is a frequent cause of gradual regressions.
