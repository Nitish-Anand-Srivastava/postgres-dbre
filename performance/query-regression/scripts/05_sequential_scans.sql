SCRIPT NAME:
05_sequential_scans.sql

PURPOSE:
Confirms whether the regressed query's table(s) are now being scanned sequentially where an index scan would be expected.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 05 of workflow 'performance/query-regression'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
../../query-optimization/query-plan-regression/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A recent jump in seq_scan count on the affected table, together with a missing or invalid index found in script 02, is strong confirmatory evidence.
===============================================================================

-- Tables where sequential scans dominate over index scans, weighted by
-- table size, to prioritize the biggest opportunity first. A high seq_scan
-- count alone is not necessarily bad (small lookup tables are often scanned
-- sequentially by design and that is faster than an index scan) -- the
-- seq_tup_read/seq_scan ratio and table size are what indicate a genuinely
-- expensive full-table scan pattern.
