SCRIPT NAME:
02_relation_size_baseline.sql

PURPOSE:
Records the current per-relation size baseline so projections can be made for the relations that actually matter.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'storage-and-capacity/capacity-forecasting'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_measured_growth_from_history.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Forecast the top ten relations individually and treat everything else as a single aggregate; storage growth is concentrated enough that per-relation modelling below the top ten adds precision nobody will use. Note index_size alongside heap_size for each -- index growth generally tracks heap growth, so forecast it as part of the table rather than separately, which would double-count the same underlying insert volume.
