SCRIPT NAME:
01_index_inventory_and_usage.sql

PURPOSE:
Inventories every index with its size and scan activity, including the last-used timestamp.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'query-optimization/inefficient-index-usage'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_unused_index_candidates.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Read size and idx_scan together. A large index with substantial scans is earning its cost. A large index with no scans is pure overhead on every write to that table -- but check last_idx_scan before believing the counter, because it survives the reasoning errors that a reset idx_scan causes. On an exchange, indexes on trades and ledger_entries deserve the most scrutiny: they are the largest, and they are on the tables whose insert latency matters most.

-- Index size, scan counts, and a simple size-per-row proxy for bloat.
-- PostgreSQL 16+ also reports last_idx_scan/last_idx_tup_fetch/
-- last_idx_tup_read (timestamps) on pg_stat_all_indexes, which are included
-- here to show *when* an index was last actually useful, not just whether
-- idx_scan is currently zero since the last stats reset.
