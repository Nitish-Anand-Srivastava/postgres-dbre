SCRIPT NAME:
01_identify_statement_by_total_time.sql

PURPOSE:
Ranks statements by cumulative execution time so plan analysis effort is spent where the database actually spends its time.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor`, plus SELECT on `pg_stat_statements` (granted automatically to `pg_read_all_stats` once the extension is created; otherwise `GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_statements TO <role>;`).

PREREQUISITES:
pg_stat_statements must be listed in shared_preload_libraries (an Aurora DB cluster parameter-group change that requires a reboot) and created in the current database. This script detects its absence and prints an instructional notice instead of failing, so it is safe to run either way.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'query-optimization/analyze-query-plan'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_statement_latency_profile.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Rank by total time, not mean time: on an exchange the statement worth analyzing is usually a fast one executed enormously often (an order-book read, a balance check), not a slow report run twice a day. Note the queryid of the statement you are investigating -- every later step in this workflow refers back to it. A low cache_hit_pct on a top statement points at an I/O-bound plan, which is the strongest early hint that the access path, not the machine, is the problem.
