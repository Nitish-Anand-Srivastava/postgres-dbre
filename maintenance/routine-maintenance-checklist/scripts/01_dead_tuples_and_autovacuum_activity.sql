SCRIPT NAME:
01_dead_tuples_and_autovacuum_activity.sql

PURPOSE:
Ranks tables by dead-tuple volume and shows currently active autovacuum workers, the first stop for the vacuum-health portion of the checklist.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'maintenance/routine-maintenance-checklist'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_index_bloat_and_usage.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A table with a high dead-tuple ratio that keeps recurring run over run despite autovacuum activity elsewhere is worth a dedicated look via vacuum-and-autovacuum/autovacuum-not-keeping-up rather than being noted and deferred again.
===============================================================================

-- Tables ranked by dead tuple ratio and absolute dead tuple count. High
-- dead-tuple ratios combined with a stale last_autovacuum timestamp are the
-- clearest sign that autovacuum is not keeping up with a table's write rate.
