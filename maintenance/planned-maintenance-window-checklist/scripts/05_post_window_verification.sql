SCRIPT NAME:
05_post_window_verification.sql

PURPOSE:
Post-window verification: settings versus intent, writer identity, connection recovery shape, and transaction age -- run before declaring the window closed.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance only (the query reads/writes state that only exists or is meaningful on the writer)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 05 of workflow 'maintenance/planned-maintenance-window-checklist'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_maintenance_window_checklist.md, ../../database-health/comprehensive-health-check/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Compare the settings block line by line against the pre-window baseline from script 03 of minor-version-upgrade-readiness or script 01 of parameter-group-change-management: any difference that was not the intended change is the finding, and any intended change that is missing means the change is only half-applied (check pending_restart). is_reader_instance must be false on the writer endpoint. A connection profile dominated by idle-in-transaction sessions, or a total count far above baseline, is a reconnect storm or a pool that has not settled -- wait and re-run before closing the window. XID age should be continuous with the pre-window value; a jump is not caused by maintenance and points at a separate problem.

-- Snapshot of the settings that most commonly explain performance and
-- concurrency behavior differences between environments. On Aurora, most of
-- these are controlled by the DB cluster parameter group (values shared by
-- all instances) or the DB instance parameter group (writer/reader-specific
-- overrides), not postgresql.conf -- use the AWS Console/CLI
-- (describe-db-cluster-parameters / describe-db-parameters) to change them,
-- not ALTER SYSTEM, which Aurora does not support for most parameters.
