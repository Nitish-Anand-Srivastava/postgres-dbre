SCRIPT NAME:
02_current_lock_graph.sql

PURPOSE:
Captures the current lock graph, in case a near-deadlock (a long circular wait about to be detected) is actively forming.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'concurrency-and-locking/deadlocks'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_transaction_age_of_contended_sessions.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
This will NOT show a deadlock that has already been detected and resolved (PostgreSQL aborts one side automatically within deadlock_timeout) -- its value is catching an in-progress circular wait before the detector fires, or confirming general contention shape.
