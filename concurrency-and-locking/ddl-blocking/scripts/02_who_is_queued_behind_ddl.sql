SCRIPT NAME:
02_who_is_queued_behind_ddl.sql

PURPOSE:
Shows every other session now queued behind the DDL statement's own lock request.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'concurrency-and-locking/ddl-blocking'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_root_blocker_of_ddl.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
The count and diversity of blocked_pid entries here quantifies the blast radius of the DDL-driven stall -- use this to communicate incident severity accurately.

-- Every session currently blocked waiting on at least one lock, and the
-- pid(s) directly blocking it via the built-in pg_blocking_pids() helper
-- (this correctly follows lock-wait-queue order, unlike a naive self-join
-- on pg_locks).
