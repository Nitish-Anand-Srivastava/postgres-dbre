===============================================================================
SCRIPT NAME:
02_most_contended_relations.sql

PURPOSE:
Identifies which specific relations/locks currently have the most waiters.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'concurrency-and-locking/lock-contention'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_ddl_style_locks.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Group mentally by relation_name; a small number of tables accounting for most waiting rows are your highest-priority fix targets.
