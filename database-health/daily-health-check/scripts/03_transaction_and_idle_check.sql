SCRIPT NAME:
03_transaction_and_idle_check.sql

PURPOSE:
Finds the oldest open transactions and any sessions sitting idle inside a transaction.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'database-health/daily-health-check'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_vacuum_debt_check.sql, ../../connections/idle-in-transaction/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
An overnight batch job (reconciliation, settlement export, compliance extract) that left a transaction open is the classic daily finding here: it blocks vacuum cluster-wide and inflates XID age for as long as it lives. Note the application_name and client_addr so the owning team can be contacted directly rather than through a broadcast.

-- Transactions (not just active queries) open longer than :min_minutes
-- minutes, ordered by age. A transaction can be "idle in transaction" or
-- actively running a query and still be the oldest open transaction on the
-- instance -- which is what actually matters for vacuum horizon and lock
-- retention, not just the current query's runtime.

-- Sessions sitting idle inside an open transaction for longer than
-- :min_minutes minutes. These hold open snapshots/locks and are a very
-- common cause of autovacuum being unable to clean up dead tuples, and of
-- unexpected lock waits on otherwise unrelated statements.
