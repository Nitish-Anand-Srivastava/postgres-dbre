SCRIPT NAME:
02_strong_lock_modes_held.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks for ShareUpdateExclusive and stronger locks that a migration would have to queue behind.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'database-health/pre-deployment-check'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_long_running_transactions.sql, ../../concurrency-and-locking/ddl-blocking/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
These are exactly the lock modes that conflict with DDL. A granted ShareUpdateExclusiveLock is usually an autovacuum worker or an in-flight concurrent index build; a granted AccessExclusiveLock means another DDL statement is already running and this deployment must wait. Match the relation names against the migration's target tables before deciding.

-- Sessions waiting specifically on AccessExclusiveLock / ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
-- style locks typically taken by DDL (CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE, VACUUM,
-- TRUNCATE). A queue of these is the classic "DDL blocking the whole app"
-- incident: the DDL itself is waiting on a long-running transaction while
-- every subsequent query queues up behind the DDL's own lock request.
