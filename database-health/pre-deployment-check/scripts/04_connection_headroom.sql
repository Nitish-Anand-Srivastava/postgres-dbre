SCRIPT NAME:
04_connection_headroom.sql

PURPOSE:
Verifies there is enough connection headroom for a rolling restart of the application fleet.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 04 of workflow 'database-health/pre-deployment-check'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
05_replication_lag_baseline.sql, ../../connections/connection-pooling/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A rolling restart briefly doubles a service's connection count as new pods warm their pools before old ones drain. Headroom below roughly 20% means the deployment can exhaust connections mid-roll, at which point neither the old nor the new version can serve traffic and the rollback path itself needs connections it cannot get.

-- Current connection utilization vs. the effective connection ceiling.
-- On Aurora, max_connections is derived from the instance class's memory
-- (via the parameter group formula) rather than freely set, so headroom
-- must be planned around instance class, not just the GUC value alone.
