SCRIPT NAME:
02_writer_checkpoint_correlation.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks writer checkpoint activity to correlate against lag spikes.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance only (the query reads/writes state that only exists or is meaningful on the writer)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'replication-and-ha/reader-lag-investigation'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
../replication-lag/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A high pct_forced_checkpoints occurring in the same window as observed lag spikes suggests checkpoint-driven WAL/I/O bursts as a contributing factor.

-- Checkpointer statistics. PostgreSQL 17 moved these counters out of
-- pg_stat_bgwriter into their own pg_stat_checkpointer view -- do not query
-- pg_stat_bgwriter for checkpoint counters on 17, they no longer exist
-- there. Frequent num_requested (forced) checkpoints relative to num_timed
-- (scheduled) checkpoints indicates checkpoint_timeout/max_wal_size are too
-- small for the current write rate.
