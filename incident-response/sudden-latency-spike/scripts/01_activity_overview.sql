===============================================================================
SCRIPT NAME:
01_activity_overview.sql

PURPOSE:
Broad session/state snapshot to size the spike before drilling into any single cause.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'incident-response/sudden-latency-spike'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_wait_event_mix.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Compare session_count and longest_query_runtime against your normal baseline for this time of day. A high active count with short runtimes is a throughput problem; a moderate active count with very long runtimes is a small number of expensive statements, and the two need opposite responses.
