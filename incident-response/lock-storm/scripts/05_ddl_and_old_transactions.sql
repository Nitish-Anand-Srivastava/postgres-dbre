SCRIPT NAME:
05_ddl_and_old_transactions.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks the two most common storm roots: a DDL statement queued on a strong lock, and a very old open transaction.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 05 of workflow 'incident-response/lock-storm'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
06_clear_the_root_blocker.md, ../../schema-changes/failed-index-build/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A DDL row with granted = false means the DDL is itself waiting and everything that arrived after it is queued behind its request -- cancelling that DDL is usually the cheapest and safest fix available, because a cancelled DDL rolls back cleanly with no data change. A transaction older than the storm is the other classic root.

-- Sessions waiting specifically on AccessExclusiveLock / ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
-- style locks typically taken by DDL (CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE, VACUUM,
-- TRUNCATE). A queue of these is the classic "DDL blocking the whole app"
-- incident: the DDL itself is waiting on a long-running transaction while
-- every subsequent query queues up behind the DDL's own lock request.
