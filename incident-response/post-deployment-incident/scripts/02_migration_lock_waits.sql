SCRIPT NAME:
02_migration_lock_waits.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks for migration DDL holding or waiting for strong locks -- the most common and most damaging deployment failure mode.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'incident-response/post-deployment-incident'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_index_build_state.sql, ../lock-storm/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A DDL row with granted = false means the migration is itself waiting, and every query that arrived after it is queued behind its lock request. That is why a single waiting ALTER TABLE looks exactly like a total outage on that table. The blocked list quantifies the blast radius for the incident channel.

-- Sessions waiting specifically on AccessExclusiveLock / ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
-- style locks typically taken by DDL (CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE, VACUUM,
-- TRUNCATE). A queue of these is the classic "DDL blocking the whole app"
-- incident: the DDL itself is waiting on a long-running transaction while
-- every subsequent query queues up behind the DDL's own lock request.
