SCRIPT NAME:
03_connection_slot_saturation.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks whether the cluster is refusing new connections because its connection slots are full -- the most common cause of a total-outage report against a healthy database.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'incident-response/database-unavailable'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_session_outcome_counters.sql, ../connection-exhaustion/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
pct_utilized at or above roughly 95% means new connections are being refused with 'too many clients' while existing sessions run normally. A state breakdown dominated by 'idle' means a pool is hoarding slots it is not using; dominated by 'idle in transaction' means an application is leaking open transactions; dominated by 'active' means genuine load.

-- Current connection utilization vs. the effective connection ceiling.
-- On Aurora, max_connections is derived from the instance class's memory
-- (via the parameter group formula) rather than freely set, so headroom
-- must be planned around instance class, not just the GUC value alone.
