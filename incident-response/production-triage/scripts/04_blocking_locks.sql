SCRIPT NAME:
04_blocking_locks.sql

PURPOSE:
Step 4 of 10: every blocked session, its blocking pids, and what each blocker is actually doing.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 04 of workflow 'incident-response/production-triage'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
05_long_running_queries.sql, ../lock-storm/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Non-empty output makes this a blocking incident first, whatever else the checklist shows -- nothing else can be fixed while the wait graph is stalled. Note how few distinct blocking pids there usually are relative to blocked sessions: that ratio is why a single action so often fixes everything. A blocker that is idle in transaction is the safest target; continue to script 05 before acting.

-- Every session currently blocked waiting on at least one lock, and the
-- pid(s) directly blocking it via the built-in pg_blocking_pids() helper
-- (this correctly follows lock-wait-queue order, unlike a naive self-join
-- on pg_locks).
