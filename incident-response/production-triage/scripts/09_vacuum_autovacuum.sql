SCRIPT NAME:
09_vacuum_autovacuum.sql

PURPOSE:
Step 9 of 10: running vacuum workers and the tables carrying the most dead tuples.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 09 of workflow 'incident-response/production-triage'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
10_storage_and_growth.sql, ../../database-health/comprehensive-health-check/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Two findings live here. Vacuum workers on large hot tables during peak traffic are competing for the same resources as the order path. A high dead_tuple_pct with a stale last_autovacuum means vacuum cannot keep up -- and if script 06 found an old transaction, that is very likely why, because vacuum cannot clean past the oldest open snapshot.

-- Autovacuum (and manual VACUUM/ANALYZE) workers currently running, and
-- what phase they are in via pg_stat_progress_vacuum. On PG17 the dead
-- tuple counters are reported in bytes (max_dead_tuple_bytes /
-- dead_tuple_bytes), not tuple counts, reflecting the new TID-store based
-- vacuum implementation.
