SCRIPT NAME:
05_long_running_queries.sql

PURPOSE:
Step 5 of 10: currently active queries running longer than the workload's normal profile.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 05 of workflow 'incident-response/production-triage'

RELATED SCRIPTS:

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
On an exchange OLTP path, anything past a few seconds is abnormal. One unique long query alongside otherwise-normal traffic is a runaway; the same statement shape repeated across many pids is a regression or a retry storm. Capture the query text now -- it is gone the moment the session ends.

-- Active queries currently running longer than :min_seconds seconds.
-- Adjust :min_seconds for your workload's normal latency profile; a
-- crypto-exchange OLTP path is typically sub-100ms, so even a handful of
-- seconds may already indicate a problem.
