SCRIPT NAME:
05_maintenance_competing_for_cpu.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks whether autovacuum or other maintenance work is competing with application traffic for the same cores.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 05 of workflow 'incident-response/high-cpu'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
06_cpu_mitigation_actions.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Several autovacuum workers on large hot tables during peak hours is a real and deferrable CPU cost. But check the dead-tuple ranking before deferring anything: a table with a very high dead_tuple_pct needs that vacuum, and starving it trades a CPU spike today for a bloat and wraparound problem next week.
