SCRIPT NAME:
03_top_active_queries_now.sql

PURPOSE:
Lists the active queries running longest right now, so the dominant statement shape can be identified in seconds.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'incident-response/high-cpu'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_top_statements_by_total_time.sql, ../runaway-query/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Look for repetition. The same normalized statement appearing across many pids is either a legitimate hot path that has become too expensive or a retry storm; a single long unique query alongside normal traffic is a runaway query. Note the pids for the runbook and the queryid for the deep dive.
