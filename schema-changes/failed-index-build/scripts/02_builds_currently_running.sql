SCRIPT NAME:
02_builds_currently_running.sql

PURPOSE:
Confirms whether any index build is still in progress, because an in-flight build legitimately appears invalid until it completes.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 02 of workflow 'schema-changes/failed-index-build'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
03_failure_context_and_settings.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
This is a mandatory safety gate, not an optional check. An index belonging to a build that is still running shows as invalid in the catalog and will become valid the moment the build finishes -- dropping it mid-build destroys hours of work and forces a restart from the beginning. If any row here names an index that also appeared in script 01, stop: that build is alive and should be monitored, not cleaned up. Only when this result set is empty, or contains no row matching your intended drop target, is it safe to proceed to the cleanup runbook.

-- Live progress of any index build currently running on this instance,
-- read from pg_stat_progress_create_index. This covers both the blocking
-- and the non-blocking build forms as well as reindex operations; the
-- `command` column tells you which one is running.
--
-- The `phase` column is the key field: a build that is parked in
-- "waiting for writers before validation" or "waiting for readers before
-- marking dead" is not slow because of I/O -- it is waiting for older
-- transactions to finish, and no amount of waiting will help until those
-- transactions commit or are ended. `current_locker_pid` names the exact
-- backend being waited on.
