SCRIPT NAME:
04_long_running_transactions.sql

PURPOSE:
Finds the long-running transactions that are the usual reason a DDL statement cannot acquire its lock.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 04 of workflow 'schema-changes/large-table-ddl'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
05_ddl_safety_settings.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A DDL statement needs its lock to be conflict-free against every existing holder, and a transaction that has been open for an hour holding even a weak lock on the table will block it. Sessions in state 'idle in transaction' are the most common culprit and the most frustrating: they are doing no work at all while preventing the schema change entirely, and they are almost always a connection-pool leak or a forgotten terminal rather than deliberate. Clear these before executing. Note that clearing them is not a permanent fix -- if they recur, set idle_in_transaction_session_timeout so they cannot accumulate, or every future schema change will hit the same wall.
