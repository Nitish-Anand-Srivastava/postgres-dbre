SCRIPT NAME:
03_current_lock_activity.sql

PURPOSE:
Shows the current DDL-style lock picture so a change is not attempted into an existing lock queue.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'schema-changes/large-table-ddl'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_long_running_transactions.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Run this immediately before executing, not an hour earlier -- the lock picture changes by the second. Any ungranted AccessExclusiveLock request already queued on your target table means an application stall is either happening now or about to, and adding your own DDL to that queue makes it worse. The second result set is the ground truth for who holds what on which object, ordered with ungranted requests first. If anything is waiting on your target table, resolve that before you start; a clean lock picture at the moment of execution is what makes the difference between a millisecond metadata change and an incident.

-- Sessions waiting specifically on AccessExclusiveLock / ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
-- style locks typically taken by DDL (CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE, VACUUM,
-- TRUNCATE). A queue of these is the classic "DDL blocking the whole app"
-- incident: the DDL itself is waiting on a long-running transaction while
-- every subsequent query queues up behind the DDL's own lock request.
