SCRIPT NAME:
03_current_lock_activity.sql

PURPOSE:
Shows the current lock picture and long-running transactions immediately before the statement is executed.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 03 of workflow 'schema-changes/add-column-large-table'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
04_add_column_execution_runbook.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Run this in the minute before executing, not earlier -- the lock picture changes constantly on a busy exchange database. Even the fast form of ADD COLUMN needs an AccessExclusiveLock, and if it cannot get one immediately it queues, and every subsequent query on the table queues behind it. A long-running transaction holding any lock on the target table will cause exactly that. Clear the blockers or wait for a clean moment, and always execute with a lock timeout so that a failure to acquire is harmless rather than an application stall.

-- Sessions waiting specifically on AccessExclusiveLock / ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
-- style locks typically taken by DDL (CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE, VACUUM,
-- TRUNCATE). A queue of these is the classic "DDL blocking the whole app"
-- incident: the DDL itself is waiting on a long-running transaction while
-- every subsequent query queues up behind the DDL's own lock request.
