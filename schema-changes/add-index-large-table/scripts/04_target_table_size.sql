SCRIPT NAME:
04_target_table_size.sql

PURPOSE:
Measures the target table to estimate build duration and the storage the new index will consume.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 04 of workflow 'schema-changes/add-index-large-table'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
05_large_table_index_build_runbook.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Use total_size_bytes for a duration estimate, then multiply by two or three for the concurrent form, which makes two full passes plus two waits for older transactions to finish. Be honest about the result: a build estimated at six hours will span market events and possibly a deployment, and it is exposed to an Aurora failover for that whole period. If n_dead_tup is high and last_autovacuum is stale, vacuum first -- the build has to read dead tuples too, so a bloated table makes an already long build longer. Edit the schema_name and table_name variables at the top for your real target.

-- Size, row estimate, and maintenance state for a single target table --
-- the numbers that determine how long a rewriting DDL statement will hold
-- its lock, and therefore whether the operation can be done directly or
-- needs the online (build-alongside-and-swap) pattern instead.
--
-- Ships with an illustrative default (public.trades); edit the \set lines
-- below for your real target. to_regclass() is used throughout rather than
-- a ::regclass cast, because a cast raises "relation does not exist" and
-- aborts the statement outright when the name is absent, whereas
-- to_regclass() simply returns NULL and lets the guard print guidance.
