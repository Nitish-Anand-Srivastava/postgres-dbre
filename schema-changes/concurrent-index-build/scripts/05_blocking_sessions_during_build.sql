SCRIPT NAME:
05_blocking_sessions_during_build.sql

PURPOSE:
Identifies the sessions a stalled build is waiting on, and what those sessions are actually doing.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Writer instance preferred; safe to run on a reader but results reflect only that reader's local activity

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 05 of workflow 'schema-changes/concurrent-index-build'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
../ddl-lock-investigation/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Use this the moment the progress view shows a waiting phase that is not advancing. The first result set expands every blocked session into one row per blocker with the blocker's own state and transaction age, which is what you need to decide whether to wait or abandon. Pay particular attention to a blocker in state 'idle in transaction' with a large blocking_txn_age: that session is doing no work at all and will block the build until someone closes it, so contacting the owning team is far more productive than waiting. The second result set shows the DDL-style lock queue on the table, which reveals whether anything else has queued behind the build's own lock -- if it has, the situation is escalating and abandoning the build may be the right call.

-- For every blocked session, expand pg_blocking_pids() into one row per

-- decide whether to wait, escalate, or (rarely, and only if authorized)
-- terminate the blocking backend.

-- Sessions waiting specifically on AccessExclusiveLock / ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
-- style locks typically taken by DDL (CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE, VACUUM,
-- TRUNCATE). A queue of these is the classic "DDL blocking the whole app"
-- incident: the DDL itself is waiting on a long-running transaction while
-- every subsequent query queues up behind the DDL's own lock request.
