SCRIPT NAME:
01_index_bloat_and_usage.sql

PURPOSE:
Index size and usage statistics to identify large, potentially bloated indexes.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'vacuum-and-autovacuum/index-bloat'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
../../schema-changes/concurrent-index-build/README.md

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
A large index_size relative to the table's row count and low idx_tup_fetch efficiency suggests bloat; confirm with pgstattuple if a precise figure is needed before scheduling a REINDEX.

-- Index size, scan counts, and a simple size-per-row proxy for bloat.
-- PostgreSQL 16+ also reports last_idx_scan/last_idx_tup_fetch/
-- last_idx_tup_read (timestamps) on pg_stat_all_indexes, which are included
-- here to show *when* an index was last actually useful, not just whether
-- idx_scan is currently zero since the last stats reset.
