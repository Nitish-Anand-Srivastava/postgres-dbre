SCRIPT NAME:
01_locks_conflicting_with_vacuum.sql

PURPOSE:
Checks for locks on candidate tables that would conflict with vacuum's required ShareUpdateExclusiveLock.

AURORA POSTGRESQL VERSION:
Aurora PostgreSQL 17+ (compatible with community PostgreSQL 17+ unless a note says otherwise)

EXECUTION LOCATION:
Any instance (writer or reader)

SAFETY:
READ ONLY

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Minimal -- reads system catalogs/statistics views only, no table locks beyond a brief catalog lookup.

REQUIRED PRIVILEGES:
Role membership in `pg_monitor` (or `pg_read_all_stats`) is sufficient. No superuser required.

PREREQUISITES:
None beyond CONNECT on the target database.

EXECUTION ORDER:
Step 01 of workflow 'vacuum-and-autovacuum/vacuum-blocked'

RELATED SCRIPTS:
02_transactions_predating_dead_tuples.sql

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
Any granted lock at ShareUpdateExclusiveLock or stronger on a table that needs vacuuming will prevent a new vacuum from starting until it is released.

-- Sessions waiting specifically on AccessExclusiveLock / ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
-- style locks typically taken by DDL (CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE, VACUUM,
-- TRUNCATE). A queue of these is the classic "DDL blocking the whole app"
-- incident: the DDL itself is waiting on a long-running transaction while
-- every subsequent query queues up behind the DDL's own lock request.
